WellTrakMulti
=============

Creating an app that tracks visits to multiple wells on a route to help me learn programming for Android. The main features include the use of `NavigationDrawer`, `ViewPager` and `SQLite`.

## Attributions

I'm basing my app on 3 different articles, all from AndroidHive.
